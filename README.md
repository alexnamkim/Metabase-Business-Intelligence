Get started
The easiest way to get started with Metabase is to sign up for a free trial of Metabase Cloud. You get support, backups, upgrades, an SMTP server, SSL certificate, SoC2 Type 2 security auditing, and more (plus your money goes toward improving Metabase). Check out our quick overview of cloud vs self-hosting. If you need to, you can always switch to self-hosting Metabase at any time (or vice versa).
